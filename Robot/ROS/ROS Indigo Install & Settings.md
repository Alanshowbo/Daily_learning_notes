## Install ROS
Use Exbot source in china:
```
sudo sh -c '. /etc/lsb-release && echo "deb http://ros.exbot.net/rospackage/ros/ubuntu/ $DISTRIB_CODENAME main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list'
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://pool.sks-keyservers.net --recv-key 421C365BD9FF1F717815A3895523BAEEB01FA116
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-desktop-full
echo "source /opt/ros/indigo/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
sudo apt-get install python-rosinstall
sudo rosdep init
rosdep update
```

## Building ROS Packages with Catkin
### Create a catkin Workspace
If you followed the Ubuntu ROS installation instructions, all ROS packages and metapackages will be found under /opt/ros/release, where release is the name of the release of ROS you are using; e.g. /opt/ros/indigo. This is a read-only part of the file system and should not be changed except through the package manager, so you'll want to create a personal ROS directory in your home directory so you can (1) install third-party ROS packages that don't have Debian versions and (2) create your own ROS packages.
```
mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
cd ~/catkin_ws/src
catkin_init_workspace
cd ~/catkin_ws
catkin_make
```
After building any new catkin package(s), be sure to source the ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash file and rebuild the ROS package path as follows:
```
source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
rospack profile
```
> This will ensure that ROS can find any new packages, message types and Python modules belonging to the newly built package(s).Add the source command above to the end of your ~/.bashrc file so that new terminals will automatically pick up your catkin packages. 
```
echo "source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
```
### Doing a "make clean" with catkin
> CAUTION! Do not include the src directory in the rm command below or you will lose all your personal catkin source files!
```
cd ~/catkin_ws
\rm -rf devel build install
```
You would then remake any packages as usual:
```
cd ~/catkin_ws
catkin_make
source devel/setup.bash
```
### Rebuilding a Single catkin Package
> If you update a single package in your catkin workspace and want to re-build just that package, use the following variation of catkin_make:
```
cd ~/catkin_ws
catkin_make --pkg package_name
```

### Networking Between a Robot and a Desktop Computer
An easy way to keep your computers synchronized is to install the Ubuntu chrony package on both your desktop and your robot:
```
sudo apt-get install chrony
```

### Installing Packages with Git
```
cd ~/catkin_ws/src
git clone git://repository/package_name
cd ~/catkin_ws
catkin_make
source devel/setup.bash
rospack profile
```
To update the package later on, run the commands:
```
cd ~/catkin_ws/src/package_name
git pull
cd ~/catkin_ws
catkin_make
source devel/setup.bash
```
### Removing Packages from your Personal catkin Directory
To remove a package installed in your personal catkin directory, first remove the entire package source directory or move it to a different location outside of your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH. For example, to remove a package called my_catkin_package from your ~/catkin_ws/src directory, run the commands:
```
cd ~/catkin_ws/src
\rm -rf my_catkin_package
```
You also have to remove all catkin build objects. Unfortunately, there is no (easy) way to do this for just the package you removedâ€”you have to remove all build objects for all packages and then rerun catkin_make:
```
cd ~/catkin_ws
\rm -rf devel build install
catkin_make
source devel/setup.bash
```
You can test that the package has been removed using the roscd command:
```
roscd my_ros_package
```
### Find Third-Party ROS Packages
+ Searching the ROS Wiki
+ Using the roslocate Command:
```
roslocate uri ros_arduino_bridge
```
which should yield the result:
```
Using ROS_DISTRO: indigo
Not found via rosdistro - falling back to information provided by rosdoc
https://github.com/hbrobotics/ros_arduino_bridge.git
```
This means that we can install the package into our personal catkin directory using the git command:
```
cd ~/catkin_ws/src
git clone git://github.com/hbrobotics/ros_arduino_bridge.git
cd ~/catkin_ws
catkin_make
source devel/setup.bash
rospack profile
```
